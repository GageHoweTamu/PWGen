PWGen is a password generator that takes three parameters: your current website, an email or username, and a password. The algorithm is deterministic, meaning it always results to the same password. This means PWGen never stores your passwords; they will be generated again with your `seed` as a key. Protect your with your life, and don't tell anyone! :)

PWGen saves your email and automatically populates the website box, meaning you can quickly generate passwords from your `seed`.
